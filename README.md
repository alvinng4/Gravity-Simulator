# 2D-N-body-gravity-simulator
Welcome to my CS50 Python project: 2D N-body gravity simulator. This project is currently in the initial stage of development. More functions are going to be implemented in the future.

## Quick Start
### Install required packages

Before running the program, make sure that you have the pygame and numpy packages installed. You can install them by running the following command in terminal:
```
pip3 install pygame
pip3 install numpy
```
### Run the program
Once you have downloaded the source files, open a terminal window, navigate to the directory of the source files and run:
```
python3 gravity_sim
```
Note that the menu buttons may not work perfectly on the first execution of the program.

## Implemented Features:
* Movable camera
* Menu
* Statistics board displaying FPS, number of objects, etc.

## Control
`W` `A` `S` `D`: move camera\
`Esc`: Open the menu 

## Key functions to be developed in the future:
1. Simulation function (Main focus)
2. `Left click`: Create new gravitational object
3. `Arrow up and down`: Change the rate of mass change when creating new object
4. `P`: Pause
