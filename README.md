# 2D-N-body-gravity-simulator
Welcome to my CS50 Python project: 2D N-body gravity simulator. This project is currently in the initial stage of development. More functions are going to be implemented in the future.

## Quick Start
Before running the program, make sure you have the pygame and numpy packages installed. You can install them by running the following command:
```
pip3 install pygame
```
```
pip3 install numpy
```
After downloading the program, you can run the program by
```
python3 2D-N-body_gravity_simulator/gravity_sim
```

## Implemented Features:
* Movable camera
* Menu
* Statistics board displaying FPS, number of objects, etc.

## Control
`W` `A` `S` `D`: move camera\
`Esc`: Open the menu 

## Key functions to be developed in the future:
1. `P`: Pause
2. `Left click`: Create new gravitational object
3. `Arrow up and down`: Change the rate of mass change when creating new object
4. Main simulation function
