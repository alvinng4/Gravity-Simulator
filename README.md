# 2D-N-body-gravity-simulator
Welcome to my 2D N-body gravity simulator project. This is still in the initial stage of development. More functions are going to be implemented in the future.

## Progress


## Available functions:
WASD: move camera\
"Esc" Menu -> Resume / Exit

## Key functions to be developed in the future:
"P": Pause\
Left click: Create new gravity object\
Arrow up and down: Change the rate of mass change when creating new object
