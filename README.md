# grav_sim

Gravity simulation library written in C with Python API.

Target Audience: Physics students, or anyone who is interested in N-body simulations.

Note: This project is currently in active development.
There could be many incoming changes.

Features:
* Ten integrators including WHFast and IAS15
* Barnes-Hut algorithm for large $N$
* Particle-Mesh method for cosmological structure formation
* Multiple sample projects

## Documentation
The documentations are currently outdated. Check `tutorial.ipynb`, `kirkword_gaps/` and `cosmic_structure` in the `examples/` folder for sample usage.

## Sample projects

Some projects are done with the API. The scripts are stored at the `examples` folder.
