# 2D-N-body-gravity-simulator
Welcome to my CS50 Python project, 2D N-body gravity simulator. This project is currently in the initial stage of development. More functions are going to be implemented in the future.

## Requirements
Before running the program, make sure you have the pygame package installed. You can install it by running the following command:
```
pip3 install pygame
```

## Implemented Features:
Movable camera\
Menu\
Statistics board displaying FPS, number of objects, etc.

# Control
**WASD**: move camera\
**Esc**: Open the menu 

## Key functions to be developed in the future:
**P**: Pause\
**Left click**: Create new gravity object\
**Arrow up and down**: Change the rate of mass change when creating new object\
Main simulation function
